Sugar, sex and your health: The connection you might be ignoring

When most of us think about sugar, I bet we’re not thinking about our sex lives. We’re thinking about dessert. I’m writing this with the help of a bowl of vanilla ice cream by my side.

Sugar makes us feel good in the moment, but over time, too much of it may cause us to lose out on some of life’s most intimate moments.

In 2025, everyone’s been buzzing about GLP-1 injections to help control sugar and lose weight. This new class of medication has helped many achieve meaningful health gains — including improved blood sugar, weight loss — and even improvements to people’s sex lives (because they could be getting better sleep, too).

My goal here isn’t to discount the use of GLP-1 drugs or suggest people are taking them unnecessarily (although some people may be). My intent is to spark a broader conversation: What if we also paid more attention to the root cause: our love for sugar and its downstream effects on mood, metabolism, sex and more?
